🎮 Welcome to the exciting world of **Monster Adventures**! This electrifying project draws inspiration from the legendary Dino Game and features an unlikely trio of main characters: **a fearless zombie**, **a cunning spider** and.... yes, you heard right, the **energetic carrot**! Together they are ready to embark on a chilling adventure that will test your skills to the max.

<br><br>
🏃‍♂️ With your trusty keyboard as your only weapon, you'll navigate your way through this amazing world. Prepare yourself, because the left and right keys are your lifeblood, determining whether you will make it through the upcoming obstacles unscathed.

<br><br>
🚀 Are you ready to take the leap of your gaming life? When the challenge reaches its peak, the mighty spacebar becomes the pass to jump defying gravity, allowing you to soar above the obstacles in your path. The higher you jump, the bolder your adventure becomes!

<br><br>
🏆 Your mission is clear: survive as long as possible and jump over as many treacherous rocks as your reflexes will allow. It's a race against time, and every move you make matters.

<br><br>
🌟 Dare to push your limits and reach for the title of the best Monster Adventures champion. Remember, however, that the game stops the moment you are late and fail to avoid an obstacle. Your fate is in your hands!

<br><br>
💪 Are you up for the challenge? Will you rise to the challenge and overcome this scorching adventure? It's time to test your skills in the **Monster Adventures** game!

<br><br>
**Good luck! Jump over them all to become the best!**

This was my first of the project, so the project only works on larger screens, on mobile devices unfortunately not.
